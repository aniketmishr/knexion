## 🎯 Project Overview

Knexion is an Agentic Knowledge Orchestrator designed specifically for students who struggle to connect concepts across their course materials. Instead of just retrieving information, Knexion builds a living knowledge graph that understands the relationships between concepts, bridging gaps with web search when needed, and delivering contextual answers that help students learn more effectively.

### 🎓 Built for Students

Every student faces the challenge of understanding how different concepts relate to each other across textbooks, lectures, and assignments. Knexion solves this by creating an intelligent knowledge network from your materials and providing answers with full context and concept relationships.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 **Intelligent Knowledge Construction**
- **PDF Processing**: Upload textbooks, lecture notes, and study materials
- **Knowledge Graph Creation**: Automatically extracts entities, concepts, and relationships
- **Vector Embeddings**: Semantic search across your entire knowledge base
- **Concept Mapping**: Visual representation of how ideas connect

### 🔍 **Hybrid Retrieval System**
- **Graph-Based Reasoning**: Understands conceptual relationships
- **Vector Similarity Search**: Finds semantically related content
- **Adaptive Gap Bridging**: Automatically searches the web when knowledge is incomplete
- **Context Fusion**: Combines multiple sources for comprehensive answers

### 🤖 **Agentic Workflow**
- **Quality Validation**: Multiple layers of answer verification
- **Hallucination Detection**: Ensures responses are grounded in facts
- **Web Search Integration**: Fills knowledge gaps with external sources
- **Interactive Learning**: Provides knowledge graph visualizations for better understanding

### 📚 **Student-Centric Design**
